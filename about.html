    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <h3>▷ Early Life</h3>
    <p>Born in 1994 in Tehran, Iran.</p>

    <h3>▷ Music</h3>
    <p>
        At six, I began with Tombak lessons, only to be drawn soon after to electronic keyboards, classical piano, 
        and touching the world of composition with a few piano sonatas. Discovering DAWs opened up a new world of 
        electronic music, techno, ambient, and experimental rock. I co-founded an electronic band, and around that 
        time, electronic compositions by Ligeti and Stockhausen entered my world and changed my path.

    <p>
        My early undergraduate studies were in applied computer science, but the gravitational pull of 
        composer-architect Iannis Xenakis led me to leave engineering behind for composition. I studied composition 
        privately in Tehran and then at the Barenboim-Said Akademie in Berlin, where I graduated with an undergraduate 
        thesis on post-Heideggerian aesthetics in music and a recital of my compositions at the Pierre Boulez Saal. 
        Currently, I’m pursuing a Master’s in Composition at Mozarteum University Salzburg.
    </p>

    <p>
        Along the way, I’ve studied with Prof. Stephan Winkler, Prof. Arnulf Herrmann, and Prof. Jörg Widmann, 
        and attended workshops with composers like Georg Friedrich Haas, Rebecca Saunders, and Chaya Czernowin. 
        Now, I’m studying under Prof. Laure M. Hiendl for my Master’s.

    <h3>▷ Other Projects</h3>
    <h4 style="padding-left: 16px;">▷ Texts and Essays:</h4>
    <p style="padding-left: 16px;">
        I’m active in modern philosophy, particularly Object-Oriented Ontology (OOO) and ecological thought, 
        with aesthetic influences from Graham Harman and Timothy Morton. 
    </p>
    <h4 style="padding-left: 16px;">▷ Score editing, orchestrating and developing:</h4>
    <p style="padding-left: 16px;">
        Years of working at Notengrafik-Berlin led me to gain score editing and proofreading skills under 
        the supervision of Senior Editor Andrew Okrzeja, and have also led me to develop tools for 
        efficient score creation, such as Sibelius plugins and MusicXML/PDF manipulation.
    </p>
        

    <h3>▷ ZSCORE</h3>
    <p>
        Through ZSCORE, I support composers in transforming their scores to another level, whether by refining notation, automating notation/compositional tasks, or enhancing final presentation quality.
        Creating what they need for their composition and concert day. (score, parts, performance material/documentations, Live-electronics programs and patches)
